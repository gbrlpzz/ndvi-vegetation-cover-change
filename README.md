# Forest Change Detection (1985-2025) using Landsat

## Overview

This Google Earth Engine (GEE) script performs a retrospective analysis of forest change across 40 years of data from 1985 to 2025 for a specified Region of Interest (ROI). It utilizes harmonized surface reflectance data from Landsat 5, 7, 8, and 9 missions to generate two primary outputs:

Deforestation (Loss) Mask: Areas classified as forest during the baseline period (1985–1989) that transitioned to open land by the end period (2021–2025).

Reforestation (Gain) Map: Areas classified as open land during the baseline period that transitioned to forest by the end period. For these gain areas, the map provides the approximate **epoch of detection** (5-year period) when the pixel first crossed the forest threshold.

The workflow  is optimised for regions where abandonment and forest transition occurred before the Sentinel-2 era, requiring multi-decadal Landsat continuity.

The results are displayed on the map with color coding and configured for export as GeoTIFFs to Google Drive.

## Methodology

The analysis follows a standard land cover change-detection workflow, using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as the primary proxy for forest cover.

1. Data Harmonization

All available Landsat 5, 7, 8, and 9 Level-2, Collection 2, Tier 1 Surface Reflectance data are merged. Each image is processed to mask clouds and cloud shadows using the QA_PIXEL band. Scale factors and offsets are applied to convert the data to standard surface reflectance values, and bands are renamed to NIR and Red for consistency.

2. Forest Classification

A fixed NDVI threshold of 0.45 (forestThreshold) is used to classify pixels:

NDVI > 0.45: Forest

NDVI ≤ 0.45: Open Land / Non-Forest

3. Change Calculation

Change is determined by comparing the median summer NDVI (June, July, August, September) across two distinct periods:

Baseline (Start State): 1985–1989 (5-year window)
Final (End State): 2021–2025 (5-year window)

Deforestation (Loss): Pixels that were Forest in the Start State and Open in the End State.
Reforestation (Gain): Pixels that were Open in the Start State and Forest in the End State.

4. Epoch of Recovery (5-Year Resolution)

For pixels identified as Reforestation, a 5-year epoch analysis is performed across seven periods: 1990–1994, 1995–1999, 2000–2004, 2005–2009, 2010–2014, 2015–2019, and 2020–2025. The script finds the earliest epoch in which the pixel's median summer NDVI first crosses the 0.45 forest threshold. This epoch is recorded in the finalRecoveryMap, providing 7 distinct temporal classes for visualization.

## Intended Applications

This workflow is designed for analyzing long-term land use transitions where forest cover gain or loss reflects broader socio-ecological processes. Typical use-cases include:

* **Agricultural land abandonment** and subsequent **forest encroachment**
* **Forest recovery** following disturbances, logging, or historical land-use changes
* **Landscape transition monitoring** in rural and peri-urban territories
* **Temporal mapping** of legacy land-use decisions with ecological implications

While Sentinel-2 offers higher spatial resolution (10 m), this system uses **harmonized Landsat data (30 m) since 1985** to capture **decades-long trajectories** of abandonment and forest succession. This provides the temporal depth required in regions—such as much of Italy—where major land abandonment and recovery events occurred well before the Copernicus era.
